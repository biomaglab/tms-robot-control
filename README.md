# tms-robot-control

Robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation controlled by InVesalius Navigator (https://github.com/invesalius/invesalius3)


# Configuration

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

- Edit `.env` and set the robot type, site, and other configuration parameters.

# Running

The first step is to run the relay_server.py script with an argument to set the server port

`python relay_server.py 5000`

Next, execute the main_loop.py script. Note: the main_loop should be run using the **Python Console**

`python main_loop.py`

After that, run the InVesalius app.py script (https://github.com/invesalius/invesalius3) with the --remote-host argument, specifying the same port as the relay server

 `python app.py --remote-host http://localhost:5000`

Please note that every time InVesalius is started, the main_loop is automatically restarted.

# Using Two Robots

- For instructions on how to operate two or more robots simultaneously, please see the [Multiple Robots Tutorial](docs/multiple_robots.md).
